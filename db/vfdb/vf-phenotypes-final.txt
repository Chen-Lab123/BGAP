Domain 2 is a <beta>-barrel core containing a large flexible loop for pore formation. Domain 3 is involved in heptamer formation. Domain 4 binds to anthrax toxin receptor (ATR); LF is organized into four domains:;  Domain 1 (LFn) is the PA-binding domain. Domain 2 (VIP2-like, VIP2, an ADP-ribosylating toxin from Bacillus cereus) participates in forming a binding pocket for substrate peptide. Domain 3 is a helical bundle that may contribute to substrate specificity by restricting access to the binding pocket. Domain 4 is the catalytic center;  PDB code for PA: 1ACC, LF: 1J7N, EF: 1K8T, 1K93, 1K90"	"The combination of PA and EF is edema toxin (EdTx), the combination of PA and LF is lethal toxin (LeTx); EF is a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that causes dramatic increases in intracellular concentrations of cAMP; LF is a zinc-dependent protease that cleaves mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) in their amino-terminal regions. It is a multi-functional virulence factor that appears to play a role in all stages of infection. Early in the infection, it acts to suppress immune cell and cytokine responses, thereby promoting bacterial outgrowth. Later in the disease, it induces the cytokine-independent shock-like death associated with anthrax."	"PA, EF and LF are secreted independently and assemble at the mammalian cell surface into toxin complexes. PA binds to cell-surface anthrax toxin receptor (ATR), encoded by the tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8) gene. ATR is a type I membrane protein with an extracellular von Willebrand factor type A domain (VWA) and is cleaved by furin or a furin-like protease, releases an amino-terminal 20kDa fragment (PA20) and the receptor-bound carboxy-terminal 63kDa fragment (PA63). Recently, a second PA receptor encoded by capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2) has been identified. It has 60% amino acid identity to ATR/TEM8 within the VWA/I domain, as well as a conserved MIDAS (metal ion dependent adhesion site) motif; PA63 oligomerizes into ring-shaped hepameric or actameric pre-channels and binds 3 or 4 LF/EF substrates respectively. The assembled toxic complexes are then internalized by membrane lipid rafts and directed to endosomes. The PA oligomer transforms into a transmembrane, <beta>-barrel channel. The proton motive force unfolds and translocates LF and EF through the channel. Once the enzymatic moieties have accessed the cytosolic compartment, they exert their toxic activities."

The toxins are produced as soluble monomers that bind to cell membranes via their respective receptors and oligomerize into pore-forming complexes. CDC oligomers are comprised of up to 50 monomers and form an unusually large pore (25-30nm in diameter).

"Soluble monomers of PFO bind to cholesterol-rich lipid membranes through hydrophobic loops at the tip of domain 4. Next, PFO monomers oligomerize on the membrane, ultimately forming pre-pore rings. Then, domain 3 <alpha>-helices pass through a disordered state and rearrange to form 2 <beta>-hairpins per monomer. Finally, the prepore to pore transition occurs through cooperative interactions, where the <beta>-hairpins form an extended <beta>-sheet that inserts into the membrane as a transmembrane <beta>-barrel."

The binding takes place within selected regions of the plasmamembrane that are enriched in cholesterol, gangliosides and glycophosphoinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins.; The action of BoNTs is mainly restricted to the neuromuscular junction, where they cause a long-lasting blockade of acetylcholine release. Unlike BoNTs, once internalized, TeNT undergoes retrograde axonal transport to the central nervous system, transcytosing across the synapse to internalize into the interneurons that regulate motorneuron activity. The spastic paralysis that results from intoxication with TeNT arises from the loss of spinal inhibitory control of motorneuron activity.; Like BoNT/B, BoNT/D, BoNT/F, and BoNT/G, synaptobrevin/VAMP2 is the substrate of TeNT."

The subtypes can differ up to 36% on the amino acid level within a given serotype. So far, more than 40 subtypes have been described in the literature.;  BoNT/A, B, E, F induce botulism in humans, BoNT/C and D and their mosaic variants CD and DC induce botulism in animals, BoNT/G has not been clearly assigned to a natural outbreak in humans or  animals;Additionally, several novel BoNT molecules have been pronounced: BoNT/HA (also called BoNT/FA or BoNT/H) which was involved in an infant botulism case and has been characterised as a novel mosaic type toxin and BoNT/X, both produced or encoded by C. botulinum, as well as eBoNT/J (aka BoNT/En) encoded by Enterococcus faecium; BoNTs associate with non-toxic clostridial proteins to form large, stable complexes that exist in cultures known as progenitor toxins. These progenitor toxins comprise three different forms: 12S (C 300 kDa), 16S (C 500 kDa), and 19S (C 900 kDa), and consist of neurotoxin subunits coupled with one or more non-toxic components known as neurotoxin associated proteins (NAPs). NAPs possess hemagglutinin activity (HA) protect the neurotoxin from harsh environment inside host like low pH and proteases, and include HA-17, HA-22, HA-33, and HA-55."	"BoNT is initially synthesized as a 150 kDa single-chain protein that is post-translationally nicked to form a dichain structure. The nicked neurotoxin consists of a 100 kDa heavy chain and a 50 kDa light chain (Zinc metalloprotease) linked by a disulfide bridge. The crystal structure of BoNT indicates that the heavy chain consists of a receptor binding domain (HC) and a translocation domain (HN), while the light chain contains a catalytic domain (LC).; PDB code: 3BTA, 1EPW"	"BoNTs are metalloproteinases that enter peripheral cholinergic nerve terminals, where they cleave one or two of the three core proteins of the neuroexocytosis apparatus and elicit persistent but reversible inhibition of neurotransmitter release.; BoNT also serves as a remarkably effective treatment for involuntary muscle disorders such as blepharospasm, strabismus, hemifacial spasm, certain types of spasticity in children, and other ailments."	"The BoNT mechanism of action consists of four sequential steps:; I. rapid and specific binding to the cholinergic nerve terminal membrane; II. internalization inside a vesicle endowed with an ATPase proton pump;  III. membrane translocation triggered by acidification of the vesicular lumen, which causes a structural rearrangement with membrane insertion of the toxin and translocation of the L-chain into the cytosol;  IV. expression of the L-chain proteolytic activity against specific substrates.; Receptors for BoNTs are composed of both gangliosides that bind toxins with low affinity and protein receptors that form high-affinity complexes with toxins. Synaptotagmins I and II, two homologous synaptic vesicle proteins, have been shown to function in conjunction with gangliosides to mediate entry of BoNT/B into cells. Low-affinity interactions between BoNT/A and gangliosides have also been reported. Recent studies have indicated that the synaptic vesicle protein SV2 acts as the protein receptor for BoNT/A.; BoNT light chains were identified as having zinc-dependent protease activity and to specifically target a group of proteins known as SNAREs.;The L-chains of the seven BoNTs are remarkably specific proteases:;  BoNT/B, /D, /F and /G cleave only synaptic vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) at single sites, which results in VAMP losing most of its cytosolic domain.; BoNT/A and /E cleave only 25 kDa synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP-25) at single individual sites within its C-teminus.;  BoNT/C cleaves both SNAP-25 and syntaxin."

And s1/m1 strains are more toxic than s1/m2 strains"	"Proteolytic cleavage of the VacA protoxin (140 kDa) at its N and C termini yields a 33-aa signal sequence, a mature 90-kDa secreted protein, and a C-terminal fragment that remains localized in the bacterial cell; the secreted protein is structured in two distinct parts. First, amino-terminal 37-kDa region, rich in <beta>-pleated sheets. This region begins with a 32-residue hydrophobic segment with a propensity to insert into membranes, and ends with a protease-sensitive segment. Second, the following 58-kDa part is predicted to consist of two domains, separated by a flexible segment of variable length: the first domain is highly conserved, whereas the second one is genetically considerably diverse."		"The secreted VacA toxin oligomerized into rosettes. It binds to the apical portion of epithelial cells and inserts into the plasma membrane, forming a hexameric anion-selective channel of low conductance. These channels are release bicarbonate and organic anions from the cell cytosol to support bacterial growth. The toxin channels are slowly endocytosed and eventually reach late endosomal compartment, increasing their permeability to anions with enhancements of the electrogenic vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) proton pump. In the presence of weak bases, including the ammonia generated by the Helicobacter pylori urease, osmotically active acidotropic ions will accumulate in the endosomes. This leads to water influx and vesicle swelling, and essential step in vacuole formation. By an as-yet-unidentified mechanism, the VacA toxin alters tight junctions and increases the paracellular route of permeability providing iron, nickel and other nutrients, this TER (trans-epithelial resistance) effect of VacA could be mediated through specific interaction with the recently identified cytosolic protein VIP54.; VacA is the first bacterial virulence factor that exploits the important plasma membrane sphingolipid, sphingomyelin (SM), as a cellular receptor."

"CagA injected by type IV secretion system into gastric epithelial cells and subsequently undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinase. The phosphorylated CagA specifically binds SHP-2 (Src homology 2 domain containing protein) phosphatase, activates the phosphatase activity, which, in turn might be responsible for dephosphorylation of several cellular proteins; CagA interacts with hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) receptor, c-MET. This interaction leads to deregulation of the motogenic response; Non-phosphorylated CagA binds directly to Grb2 by its EPIYA motifs, and this interaction activates the stress-kinase pathway, resulting in the scatter phenotype; Non-phosphorylated CagA associates with the epithelial tight-junction scaffolding protein, ZO-1, and the transmembrane protein junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) to induce the formation of an aberrant apical junction protein complex, which results in the loss of cell polarity, proliferation and differentiation.; CagA specifically interacts with PAR1 (partitioning-defective 1)/MARK (microtubule affinity-regulating kinase) kinase to disorganize gastric mucosal architecture underlying tissue damage and inflammation in vivo. Because normal epithelial architecture constrains cell proliferation, its disorganization by CagA may liberate cells from growth-inhibitory cues and thereby promote gastric carcinogenesis in conjunction with the phosphorylation dependent CagA activities.; H. pylori disrupts the polarity of epithelial cells to use the apical cell surface as a replicative niche. CagA's ability to disrupt host cell polarity is a key factor in enabling colonization of the apical cell surface by H. pylori."	Abstract(s) in PubMed

The activated HP-NAP receptor also stimulates a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity. The rise in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration and the activity of PI3K leads to the activation of renaturable kinases that phosphorylated the cytosolic subunits of the NADPH oxidase of phagocytes, causing their migration to the plasma membrane. Together with the Rac-1 and Rac-2 GTPases, they activate the oxidase activity with production of superoxide anions and reactive oxygen intermediates (RIOs)."	Abstract(s) in PubMed

The migration and activation of these cells is thought to be related to the local production of various proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-8. The presence of a functional cag PAI is associated with increased IL-8 production. But it is not the sole H. pylori factor able to promote IL-8 secretion; regulated by slipped-strand repair mechanism (CT dinucleotide repeats in oipA gene)"		Involved in IL-8 production	Recent research indicates that OipA and the cag PAI are both necessary for full activation of the IL-8 promoter but act via different pathways that diverge upstream of IRF-1 where only OipA is involved in the STAT1-IRF1-ISRE pathway. The mucosal inflammatory response to H. pylori infection is complex and involves different pathways converging on the IL-8 promoter	Abstract(s) in PubMed

It is postulated to function in vesicle recruitment during the biogenesis of the replication vacuole; RalF, an exchange factor for the ADP ribosylation factor protein (ARF) family of GTPases. It is required for the localization of ARF on phagosomes containing L. pneumophila. ARF is important for biogenesis of the replicative organelle; DrrA (defect in Rab1 recruitment A, also known as SidM), is a multifunction enzyme with both GDF (GDI-displacement factor, GDI: guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) and GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) activities. DrrA has the intrinsic ability to bind to the cytosolic surface of the plasma membrane. Because the L. pneumophila-containing vacuole (LCV is) initially a plasma-membrane-derived organelle, translocated DrrA protein associates with the immature LCV formed on bacterial internalization. The GDF activity of DrrA promotes the sampling of cytosolic Rab proteins associated with Rab GDI. When Rab1-Rab-GDI complexes are sampled, the removal of Rab GDI permits the GEF domain in DrrA to activate Rab1, leading to the stable association of Rab1 with the LCV membrane. Active Rab1 facilitates organization of the LCV membrane to promote the delivery and fusion of ER-derived vesicles. DrrA cycles off because the composition of the vacuole membrane changes.; LepB is a Rab1-specific GAP (GTPase-activating proteins). The LepB protein accumulates on the LCV membrane and the GAP activity facilitates the removal of Rab1 by stimulating GTP hydrolysis. The removal of Rab1 coincides with fusion of the LCV with the host ER and replication of L. pneumophila in a vacuole containing ER proteins.; Other candidate effector proteins including SidA-G (substrate of Dot/Icm transporter), Vips (VPS(vacuole protein sorting) inhibitor proteins, VipA, VipD, VipE, VipF), SdeA-D, YlfAB (yeast lethal factor A and B), their real function are unknown; Once the vacuole provides conditions for the bacteria to grow, functional genes of the dot/icm family become dispensable"	Abstract(s) in PubMed

The activation of membrane-associated NADPH oxidase leads to production of superoxide anions (O2-), which in the presence of superoxide dismutase are converted into H2O2. The fusion of lysosomal vesicles with the plasma and phagosomal membranes causes a release of myeloperoxidase (MPO), an enzyme that in the presence of H2O2 produces hypochlorite which exhibits a highly toxic potential toward pathogens. Porin prevents the vesicle fusion by insertion into the phagosomal membrane, so MPO discharges into the extracellular milieu, eventually depleting the entire secondary granula from the cell so that the bacteria can safely accommodate within the phagosome."

CdtA and CdtC mediate target cell binding and membrane translocation of CdtB, which then induces DNA damage, most probably through its nuclease activity; In the case of S. typhi, however, genes encoding CdtA and CdtC are absent. CdtB from S. typhi is produced with the pertussis-like toxins PltA and PltB only inside the host cell and is then secreted from the infected Cell in a PltA/B-Dependent manner and acts then as a classical CDT from outside;typhoid toxin seemed to have evolved from the combination of the activities of two exotoxin ancestors, CDT and pertussis toxins."

B subunits form a pentameric structure binding to its cellular receptor globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3). STxB-GB3 induces narrow tubular membrane invaginations for its uptake into cells. The A subunit is composed of two fragments, A1 and A2, linked by a disulphide bond. A subunit is proteolytically cleaved at this site by enzymes in ER and cytosol to form a 27-kDa A1 subunit, responsible for the enzymatic activity of Stx; PDB code: 1DM0"	"Important factors in disease pathogenesis and are responsible for some of the severe complications, such as haemorrhagic colitis and the haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)"	"Stx inactivates 28S ribosomal RNA by cleaving a specific N-glycosidic bond.

This conformational change is accompanied by the formation of neo-epitopes called ligand-induced binding site (LIBS) epitopes"	Facilitates attachment of the staphylococcus to host cells; may function as invasin to invade non-professional phagocytes	Fibronectin is a dimeric glycoprotein that occurs in a soluble form in body fluids and in a fibrillar form in the ECM. The primary function of fibronectin is to act as a substratum for the adhesion of cells mediated by integrin receptors that bind to specific sites in the central part of fibronectin. FnBPs bind fibronectin via the type I modules at the N-terminus. Fn is bound to the <alpha>5<beta>1 integrin on the surface of the host cell at the central fibronectin RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif-bearing module. Thus fibronectin forms a bridge between the bacterial FnBP adhesin and the mammalian cell integrin.	Abstract(s) in PubMed

They require the presence of rough LPS for enzymatic activity and are inhibited by the O-antigen chains present in smooth LPS; unique to Y. pestis encoded by the pPCP1 plasmid not present in the enteropathogenic yersiniae Y. pseudotuberculosis and  Y. enterocolitica"	The structure of Pla has a narrow <beta>-barrel with an elliptical cross-section composed of10 antiparallel <beta>-strands from which five loops L1L5 are exposed to the extracellular environmental milieu; PDB code: 2X55	"Outer membrane aspartate protease that can activate plasminogen, dissolve clots, prevent chemotaxis of PMNs, may enable the dissemination of Y. pestis from the peripheral infection site into the circulation; degradation of laminin; play a role in serum resistance by cleaving complement protein C3; Pla is involved in positioning the Ysc type III secretion system"	"The Pla surface protease resembles the mammalian plasminogen activators in function and activates plasminogen by limited proteolysis at the same Arg560-Val561 bond as do tissue-type plasminogen activator and urokinase; Direct or indirect activation of the host plasminogen is a common invasive strategy among pathogenic bacteria belonging to diverse genera, such as Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Borrelia, Helicobacter, Bacillus, Salmonella and Leptospira."
